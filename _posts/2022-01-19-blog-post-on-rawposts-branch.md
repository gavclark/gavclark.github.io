# this should be the title of the new post which is created in rawposts branch, shouldn't be visible on main branch yet ?

## heading style 2 for this test

Some DAX :

```
Sales YTD = TOTALYTD([Revenue])
```

*this should be in italic and **this in bold italic** and the rest in italic*

**this should all be bold**

> here's an indented quote block, will it come out italicised again or not ?

OK so now we're done with this test
